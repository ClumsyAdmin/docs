title: Actual Budget Vision
---

This document provides an outline of the vision of the open source version of Actual Budget, where the project would like to be, what the goals are and some of the history around Actual Budget. 

### History 

Actual Budget was designed, developed and maintained as a closed source paid product by James Longster for 4 years before he [decided](https://actualbudget.com/open-source) to release the code base to the community.

Initially there were a number of bumps in the road, the code wasn't 100% ready for the world to see it, some of the features that were integral to Actual Budget functioning just didn't work, over the first 4-5 months the community worked with James to get these issues ironed out but initially James just didn't have the time to take on the maintaining of an open source project all on his own, early 2023 a team of core maintainers took over the main bulk of the maintaining from James and have since been progressing with a number of features, some of which have been merged, some still in progress, fixes to the the existing code and plenty of improvements. 

### What Makes Actual Budget Great

Some of the things that make Actual Budget stand out from the rest include;

* Local-first
* Open (you own your data; you can do whatever you want with it)
* Sleek, clutter-free UI
* Simple to use for beginners; with progressive discoverability for advanced users (rules, schedules, and more to come)
* Stable, reliable, secure
* Privacy in mind (no tracking, no 3rd parties unless explicitly enabled)
* Community driven

### Mobile

The closed-source app provided mobile apps for Android and iOS using some tools that are no longer being maintained. Additionally, publishing apps to mobile app stores is expensive, slow, and can require lots of effort to meet platform ownersâ€™ guidelines.

Instead, Actual Budget will focus on developing an excellent web experience by combining the underlying technology and some UI components from the desktop version with some components maintained separately for mobile and desktop where there need to be significant differences in presentation. For more details, [see our dedicated mobile strategy issue](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/804).

### The Future

Some of the high-level features we would like to add to Actual Budget in the future include:

* Goal templates moved to the UI.
* Mobile transaction entry.
* Implementing and testing syncing providers other than Nordigen
* Enabling support for Nordigen and other syncing providers by default
* Darkmode.
* custom reports.
* and more
