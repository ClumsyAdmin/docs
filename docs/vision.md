title: Actual Budget Vision
---

This document provides an outline of the vision of the open source version of Actual Budget, where the project would like to be, what the goals are and some of the history around Actual Budget. 

### History 

Actual Budget was designed, developed and maintained as a closed source paid product by James Longster for 4 years before he [decided](https://actualbudget.com/open-source) to release the code base to the community.

Initially there were a number of bumps in the road, the code wasn't 100% ready for the world to see it, some of the features that were integral to Actual Budget functioning just didn't work, over the first 4-5 months the community worked with James to get these issues ironed out but initially James just didn't have the time to take on the maintaining of an open source project all on his own, early 2023 a team of core maintainers took over the main bulk of the maintaining from James and have since been progressing with a number of features, some of which have been merged, some still in progress, fixes to the the existing code and plenty of improvements. 

### What Makes Actual Budget Great

Some of the things that make Actual Budget stand out from the rest include;

* Local-first
* Open (you own your data; you can do whatever you want with it)
* Sleek, clutter-free UI
* Simple to use for beginners; with progressive discoverability for advanced users (rules, schedules, possibly running local queries against the transaction table, custom reports, etc.)
stable, reliable, secure
* Privacy in mind (no tracking, no 3rd parties unless explicitly enabled)
* Community driven

### Mobile

One of the biggest questions we get asked is do you have a plan for Mobile, the answer to that is yes however it is slightly more complicated than that, when the community took over the project the apps were signed by James he had the Apple developer accounts there was plenty of tooling that we didn't have the skills, knowledge of funding to keep up and running so quite early on a decision was made to retire the native Actual Budget apps for the closed source version of Actual Budget and replace them with a responsive version of the web application. 

The strategy for mobile is currently being tracked, [here](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues/804) at the moment you can only use this to read your budget, there is no write but that is something we as working on but no time frame is attached to that. 

### The Future

Some of the things we would like to include into Actual Budget in the future include, but are not limited to

* Goal templates moved to the UI.
* Mobile transaction entry.
* Nordigen no longer experimental.
* Darkmode.
* custom reports.
